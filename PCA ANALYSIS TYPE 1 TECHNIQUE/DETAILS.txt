THIS PCA WAS APPLIED TO 3D JOINTS OF HAND TO REDUCE IT TO LOWER DIMENSION

viewpoint invariant 3D human pose estimation,” in Proc. Eur. Conf.

.
INSTEAD OF REGRESSION TO FULL 3D JOINTS IN SPACE BETTER RESULTS ARE RECIEVED IF 
WE SWITCH TO REGRESSION TO LOWER DIMENSIONAL SPACE AND PERFORM DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION
ON 3D POINTS IN SPACE.
WE ACHIEVED THIS THROUH PCA . OUR METHOD WAS A DIFFERENT IT DID NOT 
EXPLOIT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIFFERENT HAND JOINTS IN SPACE.

THROUGH PCA ANALYSIS EVERYPOINT WAS REDUCED FROM 3D SPACE TO 1D SPACE.

DISADVANTAGES:
THIS REDUCED DIMESNION WAS UNABLE TO GIVE A BETTER REPRESENTATION OF NON-LINEARITY.
